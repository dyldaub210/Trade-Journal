## TRENDLINE STRATEGY

- Get in almost at the beginning of a new trend (UP or DOWN)
- Get in almost at the beginning of a new Market Swing (TOP or BOTTOM)
- Look at HOW MANY times the price reacted to TRENDLINES


> BUY ENTRY SETUP

![BUY](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/buy_entry_setup.png)

> SELL ENTRY SETUP

![SELL](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/sell_entry_setup.png)


## IDENTIFY CURRENT MARKET TREND (Price Direction)

> UP TRENDING MARKET (HIGHER HIGHs, HIGHER LOWs)

![UP](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/uptrend.png)

> DOWN TRENDING MARKET (LOWER HIGHs, LOWER LOWs)

![DOWN](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/downtrend.png)

> RANDING MARKET:

![RANGING](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/ranging.png)


> Changing from UPTREND to DOWNTREND
  - Pattern of successives HH HL is broken 
  - a New Low that is LOWER than the previous LOW
  - Signal of a possible Trend change
  
> Changing from DOWNTREND to UPTREND
  - Pattern of successives LH LL (end of downtrend, start of uptrend) or HH HL (end of uptrend, start of downtrend) is BROKEN
  ![TRENDCHANGE](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/trendchange.png)
  - a New HIGH that is higher than the previous HIGH
  - Signal of a possible change in the trend

 >>- Trend Change Example:
  
   ![TRENDCHANGEEXPLE](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/trendchangeexple.png)
  
### IDENTIFY TRENDLINES (The LEVELS)

> Draw Trendlines on multiple timeframes(TOP DOWN ANALYSIS):

- MONTHLY (RED)
- WEEKLY(BLUE)
- DAILY(VERT)
- 4H (PUPLE)
- 1H (ORANGE)

Identify and Connect obvious PEAKS and TROUGHS, drawing outer trendlines.
The 2  significant LOWS/PEAKS where the trendline is drawn from must be obvious and easy to identify - LOW1/PEAK1 and LOW2/PEAK2.

> How to Draw a Trendline?

- Step1: Identify obvious PEAKS and TROUGHS 
- Step2: Outer Trendlines, from most significant PEAKS and TROUGHS in larger timeframes - 1H, 4H and upwards
     * Connect a minimum of 2 PEAKS (or HIGHs) with a line from LEFT to RIGHT 
     ![SELLEXPLE](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/sell_example.png)
     * Connect a minimum of 2 TROUGHS (or LOWs) with a line from LEFT to RIGHT
      ![BUYEXPLE](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/buy_example.png)



> VALIDITY of a TRENDLINE

- A Trendline is VALID as long as it is NOT intersected SIGNIFICANTLY and Price continues to obey it. 

- A Trendline is INVALID when it is interesected SIGNIFICANTLY (The trend has probably changed) 

  >>- Verify if the candlestick that interstected the trendline closed ABOVE or BELOW it on 1H and 4H chart 
  >>- Verify the length of the candlestick that closed ABOVE the downward trendline or BELOW the upward trendline 
  >>- Verify the close on 1H and 4H chart
  >>- When a trendline becomes INVALID change it to dotted lines ( ------) KEEP it on chart if less than 40 pips away.
  >>- REMOVE An INVALID Trendline if:
   >>>- 5 Min Timeframe: breached by 5-10 pips
   >>>- 1H Timeframe: breached by 20-40 pips
   >>>- 4H Timeframe: breached by 40-60 pips
  
  
> STRONG and WEAK Trendlines (Will it HOLD)?

- Strength of the Trendline = number of times price touches the trendline and obeys it (more than once)
- Steepness (slope) of the Trendline: Strong trendlines are gently sloping trendlines (steeply sloping is unreliable)

> Mistakes to avoid when drawing Trendlines

>>- Drwaing trendlines through an obstruction between points 1 and 2 (touches candlestick bodies)
>>- Not drawing a new Trendline and keeping INVALID trendlines 
>>- Drawing trendlines not touching peaks and toughs(lines MUST TOUCH) - Avoid Missing trades


### IDENTIFY SUPPORT and RESISTANCE LEVELS 


> INSTITUTIONAL Support and resistance levels: 

Draw it Every 20, 50, 80, 100 and 200 pips.

> Hidden Support and Resistance Levels

Draw Pivot Points and Fibonacci Retracement and Projection Levels

> Dynamic Support and Resistance Levels

Add Exponential Moving Averages to Chart : EMA20, EMA50 and EMA200

> Dynamic Trendlines

> The Haramis Pattern

![HARAMI](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/bullishharami.png)


> The Hammer and Shooting Star

Validity of a Kangaroo Tail:

>- The long wick should be at least 2-3 times the length of the body of the candlestick
>- The body should be larger than previous bars range
>- The body should be present towards either the upper or lower extreme of the Pin Bar
>- The wick should stand out when compared to previous bars (with room to the left)
>- Pin Bar will affect immediately following 4-5 bars
>- Pin Bar should print at a Support and Resistance:
>- Candle rejection: The wick touches the support/resistance but the body don't
>- Ideally at the end of an impulsive move and may indicate the beginning of a reversal price momentum
>- Pin Bar that appear/close in direction of the Trend
>- IF UPTREND then BULLISH Pin Bar closes higher than the open.
>- IF DOWNTREND then BEARISH Pin Bar closes lower than the open.
>- Wait for a Pinn Bar to occur after a PullBack to support or resistance level (end of retracement move)
>- Avoid Pin Bar that doesn't show a price rejection evidence

## 3. EXECUTE A TRADE 



!!! DO NOT ENTER 'MARKET EXECUTION' ORDERS !!!!

!!! DO NOT ENTER TRADES FROM MOBILE DURING THE DAY !!!!

### ORDER ENTRY


#### STOP LOSS Definition

> SL is 30 pips

Place a stop to cover my bases in case my predictions about where the price will go is completely wrong.  

![STOPLOSS](https://github.com/zuluchaka/tradingplan/blob/master/stop_loss_place.png)

#### TAKE PROFIT Definition


The most important thing to do as a trader. Not every trade is a winner. 
> TP1 and TP2 at nearest Support/resistance zone inside previous bar range (Low Risk)


> PARTIAL PROFIT:
- Take 50% of profit at TP1
- Take 75 - 100% profit at TP2 or TP3 (Only do this after moving STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN)


#### POSITION SIZE CALCULATION

Take the appropriate risk for the trade (Not too High, Not too Low). This is the number of lots (micro, mini or standard)

> Account weekly Risk: 10%   

> Trade Risk: 3%  (Max 6 Daily trades). 

> SL is 20-30 pips

> Calculation of the AMOUNT at risk on the trade

$ at risk = (Pips at risk) X (Pips Value) X Lots traded.     
Hence Lots Traded = $ at risk / (Pips at risk X Pips Value)

> Example: 
- Account size : $1k  ( account in USD)
- $ at risk on trade: $30(3%)   
- Pips value :  
- Pair: EURUSD

Lot traded = $30/(30 x $1) = 1   

=> Take:
- 1 trade with lot 0.1 
- 3 trades with 0.03 lot size each

#### Enter ON STOP - Entry Option:

> Aggressive Entry: Immediately on the close (WAIT FOR THE CLOSE) of the candlsetick touching the trendline - MARKET EXECUTION

> Order1: Enter a BUY STOP ORDER 
Place the order a small distance (2-3 pips) above the high of the Pattern (knowing that the price has moved in the direction of profit before placing the trade).

> Order2: Enter a SELL STOP ORDER 
Place the order a small distance (5 pips) beyond the low of the pattern (in case of reversal)

> DELETE Order not triggered
After ORDER1 or ORDER2 is triggered, Delete the other STOP order that is not triggered after price movement (Immediately)


#### JOURNAL the trade
 
- Add new trade to journal : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DYp9zuLJZ5bxZBdvmD7DJhnc7vrzpv3G?ogsrc=32

## 4. MANAGE A TRADE (Preservation of Capital)

### Trailing STOP LOSS

> Upon +10 pips in profit
- Move STOP LOSS to breakeven and repeat it every 20 pips


### Cutting losing trades fast

> CLOSE THE TRADE to reduce LOSSES
- IF trade goes more than 60% against me after openining 
- IF trade is at 25% closed to my STOP LOSS




### EXIT / CONTINUATION Signals

- Zone Exit (hit profit target or stop loss or breakeven).
- 3-Bar Exit
