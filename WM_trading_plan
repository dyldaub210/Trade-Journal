## Trading Setup

### Trading Systems (patterns)

- Wammies
- Moolahs

### Anatomy of VALID Wammie & Moolah:

- TODO

### Identify Market Trend: 

Switch to LINE CHART instead of candlestick to draw Support & Resistance Zone
To Gauge strength and direction of a trend, when a trend have exhausted itself and is about to turn the other way.
We rely on a combination of:

- Trend Lines
- Moving Averages
- Support/Resistance Zone
- Large Round Numbers


IF Price > 200EMA THEN UPTREND.
IF Price < 200EMA THEN DOWNTREND

The BEST Pin Bar to trade  form during retracement at those areas of interest after a sustained move.

- Ideally a Pin Bar should close in the direction of the prevailing trend:
 * IF UPTREND then BULLISH Pin Bar closes higher than than the open.
 * IF DOWNTREND then BEARISH Pin Bar closes lower than the open.
 
### CONTINUATION PATTERN: 
If the wick of the Pin Bar is more than 4 times larger than the average trading range of the previous bars.
Always trade with the trend.

## Indicators Used for Confluence ONLY
MA - used to gauge the direction and strength of the trend - They are dynamic SR Levels. price religiously bounces off certain EMAs during retraces.

- SMA(8)
- EMA(21, 50, 200) - reacts more quickly to recent price events than SMA
- Fibonacci Retracement: 38.2, 50 and 61.8 are the most important levels for Pin Bar. Trade it in confluence with MA and EMA.
- Pivot Points

CONFLUENCE Examples: 
- TODO

## Timeframes

- 4H
- D1

## Entry Signal (On PULLBACK ONLY - WAIT FOR IT !!!!)

- External conditions to consider (market or news events):
  * check https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-economic-calendar  - if any RED flag (imapcting news) about the pair - DO NOT TRADE
  
- Conditions to enter (REASONS NOT tO TRADE): 
   * Pin Bar at previous support/resistance level. Enter on open of next bar after current pin bar
   * Check daily, weekly, monthly drawdown => lot size calculation (generate SL, TP1,TP2 and TP3)
   * Risk 2% per trade
   * Minimum Risk/Reward ration 3:1
- Add trade to journal (XLS file in GDrive) 
- Photo of the trade (BEFORE) in Trello

- Order1: Place BUY/SELL STOP ORDER a small distance (2-3 pips) beyond/above the high/low of the Pin Bar (knowing that the price has moved in the direction of profit before placing the trade).
- Order2: Place SELL/BUY STOP ORDER a small distance (5 pips) beyond/above the high/low of the Pin Bar (in case of reversal)

- Delete order that is not triggered after price movement (Immediately)

## Stop Loss
Place a stop to cover your bases in case my predictions about where the price will go is completely wrong.  

5 pips below/above Pin Bar - Risk 2% per trade

- Once the trade moves 2 or more pips in my favour bring my STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN

## Position Size (Trade Size !!!!)

Take the appropriate risk for the trade (Not too High, Not too Low). This is the number of lots (micro, mini or standard)

- Account Risk (Account risk limit per trade): 10% weekly,  

- Trade Risk: 2% per trade (Max 6 Daily trades). - Pips at risk on each trade:difference between ENTRY and STOP LOSS

SL is 30 pips

$ at risk = Pips at risk X Pips Value X Lots traded.     => Lots Traded = $ at risk / (Pips at risk X Pips Value)

Example: Account size : $1k - pips at risk on trade: $20(2%)   and Pips value = 30 pips SL 
Mini lots Lots traded = $20/(30 x $1) = 0.666 ( 6 mini lots)  


## Take Profit
The most important thing to do as a trader.
Not every trade is a winner. 
- 1. TP at nearest support/resistance zone inside previous bar range (Low Risk)
- 2. TP at previous bars LOW or HIGH (Medium Risk, risk reward ration: 1:1.5)
- 3. TP at nearest insterest level outside previous bar range 

Partial Profit:
- 50% at TP1
- 75 - 100% profit at TP2 or TP3 (Only do this after moving STOP LOSS to BREAK EVEN)

Trailing STOP LOSS
Lock in profit to leave trade unattended.


## Exit Signal

- Zone Exit (hit profit target or stop loss or breakeven).
- 3-Bar Exit
- Trailing Stop Loss (stop loss to breakeven)
- Photo of the trade (AFTER) in Trello
- Update trade in Journal (XLS file in GDrive)

## Metadata

- Monthly Max Drawndown: 40% (max 120 monthly trades)
- Weekly Max Drawdown: 10% (max 30 weekly trades)
- Daily Max Drawdown: 2% (max 6 daily trades)

## Results Analysis - Analyse 30 trades clumps
